                    The Vordingborg castle was built in 1175 by King King Valdemar I as a defensive castle and as a
                    base
                    from 
                    which to launch raids against the German coast. His half-brother built another castle in a remote
                    location,
                    which is now Copenhagen. King Valdemar II similarly used the castle for expansion into the Baltic,
                    and
                    in
                    1241 it was where he created the reformed legal system, the Law of Jutland. By the time of King
                    Valdemar
                    IV, the castle had nine towers and a defensive wall 800 metres long. The castle was the birthplace
                    of
                    Queen
                    Margaret I, daughter of King Valdemar IV, in 1353.<br><br>

                    Large parts of the castle were demolished after the Swedish wars had ended, in order to construct a
                    palace
                    for Prince George, son ofKing Frederick III. The prince never took up residence, and the palace too
                    was
                    demolished in the 18th century. Three manors were constructed nearby, including Iselingen, which
                    became
                    a
                    meeting place for many leading artists and scientists during the 1800s.<br><br>

                    Today Vordingborg Castle is a ruin, although parts of the fourteenth century ring walls remain. The
                    only
                    fully preserved part of the castle, the 26 meter tall Goose Tower (Gåsetårnet), is the symbol of
                    the
                    city.
                    The name comes from the golden goose that perches on top of the tower's spire. Although legend has
                    it
                    that
                    Valdemar Atterdag used the symbol to taunt the Hanseatic League, the truth is the goose was first
                    erected
                    in 1871. The tower was transferred into the national trust on December 24, 1808, and was thus the
                    first,
                    protected historic monument in Denmark.<br><br>

                    Next to the castle is a botanical garden and also a museum. A larger museum is planned which will
                    include
                    information on all of Denmark's historical castles. Excavations of the castle ruins continue.
                    Regular
                    archaeological digs take place here. Many of the finds are displayed in the exhibition at the
                    Danish
                    Castle
                    Centre (Danmarks Borgcenter).<br><br>
